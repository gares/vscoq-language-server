open Types

(** The document manager holds the view that Coq has of the currently open
    states. It makes it easy for IDEs to handle text edits, navigate
    and get feedback. Note that it does not require IDEs to parse vernacular
    sentences. *)

val init : Vernacstate.t -> opts:Coqargs.injection_command list -> uri:string -> text:string -> state * events
(** [init st opts uri text] initializes the document manager with initial vernac state
    [st] on which command line opts will be set. *)

val apply_text_edits : state -> text_edit list -> state
(** [apply_text_edits doc edits] updates the text of [doc] with [edits]. The
    new text is not parsed or executed. *)

val validate_document : state -> state
(** [validate_document doc] reparses the text of [doc] and invalidates the
    states impacted by the diff with the previously validated content. If the
    text of [doc] has not changed since the last call to [validate_document], it
    has no effect. *)

val interpret_to_position : state -> Position.t -> (state * events)
(** [interpret_to_position doc pos] navigates to the last sentence ending
    before or at [pos] and returns the resulting state. *)

val interpret_to_previous : state -> (state * events)
(** [interpret_to_previous doc] navigates to the previous sentence in [doc]
    and returns the resulting state. *)

val interpret_to_next : state -> (state * events)
(** [interpret_to_next doc] navigates to the next sentence in [doc]
    and returns the resulting state. *)

val interpret_to_end : state -> (state * events)
(** [interpret_to_end doc] navigates to the last sentence in [doc]
    and returns the resulting state. *)
